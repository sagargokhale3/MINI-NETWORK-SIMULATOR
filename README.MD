# Mini Network Simulator

A lightweight **network simulator** in Python demonstrating:
- **Packet transmission** between hosts
- **Routing with Dijkstra’s algorithm**
- **Network topologies:** Star, Ring, Mesh
- **Performance testing:** throughput, latency, packet loss (extendable)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Hosts send/receive packets
- Routers compute shortest paths
- CLI-based packet flow visualization
- Test cases for different topologies
