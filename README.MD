# Mini Network Simulator

A lightweight **network simulator** in Python demonstrating:
- **Packet transmission** between hosts
- **Routing with Dijkstra’s algorithm**
- **Network topologies:** Star, Ring, Mesh
- **Performance testing:** throughput, latency, packet loss (extendable)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Hosts send/receive packets
- Routers compute shortest paths
- CLI-based packet flow visualization
- Test cases for different topologies

---

## 🛠️ Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mini-network-simulator.git
cd mini-network-simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
